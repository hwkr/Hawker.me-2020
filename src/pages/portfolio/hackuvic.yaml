  As organizer for the UVic Web Design and Development Club I ran HackUVic for 2 years. I addition to managing the hackathon I did all the design and branding for the event.

  With input from the organizing team, I designed the website, t-shirts, posters, stickers, badges and other miscellaneous collateral both years.
