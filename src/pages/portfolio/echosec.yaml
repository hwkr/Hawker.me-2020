  During my time at Echosec I worked with the executive and design teams to redesign their customer facing website. I implemented the design and rebuilt the analytics to better capture user interactions. I was able to validate the new design and saw a noticeable improvement in conversion.

  I also redesigned the app login page simplifying the number steps required to sign up for an account. By using simple graphics I was also able to improve load times significantly.
